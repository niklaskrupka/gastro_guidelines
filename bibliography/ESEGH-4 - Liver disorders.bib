abstract = {These guidelines on transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) in the management of portal hypertension have been commissioned by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) under the auspices of the Liver Section of the BSG. The guidelines are new and have been produced in collaboration with the British Society of Interventional Radiology (BSIR) and British Association of the Study of the Liver (BASL). The guidelines development group comprises elected members of the BSG Liver Section, representation from BASL, a nursing representative and two patient representatives. The quality of evidence and grading of recommendations was appraised using the GRADE system. These guidelines are aimed at healthcare professionals considering referring a patient for a TIPSS. They comprise the following subheadings: indications; patient selection; procedural details; complications; and research agenda. They are not designed to address: the management of the underlying liver disease; the role of TIPSS in children; or complex technical and procedural aspects of TIPSS.},

abstract = {Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders among persons of northern European descent. There have been recent advances in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HH. The availability of molecular diagnostic testing for HH has made possible confirmation of the diagnosis for most patients. Several genotype-phenotype correlation studies have clarified the differences in clinical features between patients with the C282Y homozygous genotypes and other HFE mutation patterns. The increasing use of noninvasive tests such as MRI T2* has made quantification of hepatic iron deposition easier and eliminated the need for liver biopsy in most patients. Serum ferritin of {\textless}1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis remains an important diagnostic test to identify patients with a low risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis and should be used routinely as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Genetic testing for other types of HH is available but is expensive and generally not useful in most clinical settings. Serum ferritin may be elevated among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in those with alcoholic liver disease. These diagnoses are more common than HH among patients with elevated serum ferritin who are not C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. A secondary cause for liver disease should be excluded among patients with suspected iron overload who are not C282Y homozygotes. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of therapy, but emerging novel therapies such as new chelating agents may have a role for selected patients.},

abstract = {Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment for all types of liver failure, some non-liver failure indications and liver cancer. Most referrals come from secondary care. This first part of a two-part guideline outlines who to refer, and how that referral should be made, including patient details and additional issues such as those relevant to alcohol and drug misuse. The process of liver transplant assessment involves the confirmation of the diagnosis and non-reversibility, an evaluation of comorbidities and exclusion of contraindications. Finally, those making it onto the waiting list require monitoring and optimising. Underpinning this process is a need for good communication between patient, their carers, secondary care and the liver transplant service, synchronised by the transplant coordinator. Managing expectation and balancing the uncertainty of organ availability against the inevitable progression of underlying liver disease requires sensitivity and honesty from all healthcare providers and the assessment of palliative care needs is an integral part of this process.},

@article{Kwo2017,
abstract = {Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.},

En ella se actualiza la declaraci{\'{o}}n de posicionamiento basada en la EASL Special Conference de 2009 [1]. Los datos en los que se basa se han obtenido a trav{\'{e}}s de una amplia b{\'{u}}squeda en PubMed hasta abril de 2015. A las declaracio-nes finales se les atribuye un grado seg{\'{u}}n el nivel de la evidencia y la fuerza de la recomendaci{\'{o}}n, que puede ajustarse en funci{\'{o}}n de las regulaciones locales y/o las capacidades de los equipos (Ta-bla 1) [2]. Concretamente, los ex{\'{a}}menes de detecci{\'{o}}n de la EHGNA en la poblaci{\'{o}}n expuesta al riesgo deben realizarse seg{\'{u}}n el con-texto de recursos disponibles, teniendo en cuenta la carga que su-ponen para los sistemas de asistencia sanitaria nacionales y la li-mitaci{\'{o}}n actualmente existente en cuanto a tratamientos eficaces. El documento pretende tener una utilidad pr{\'{a}}ctica, a la vez que hacer avanzar la investigaci{\'{o}}n y el conocimiento existente sobre la EHGNA en los adultos, con una referencia espec{\'{i}}fica a la EHGNA pedi{\'{a}}trica siempre que ello sea necesario.

Definici{\'{o}}n La EHGNA se caracteriza por una acumulaci{\'{o}}n excesiva de grasa hep{\'{a}}tica, que se asocia a una resistencia a la insulina (RI), y se define por la presencia de esteatosis en {\textgreater} 5{\%} de los hepatocitos seg{\'{u}}n lo indicado por el an{\'{a}}lisis histol{\'{o}}gico o por una fracci{\'{o}}n grasa de densidad prot{\'{o}}nica (que proporciona una estimaci{\'{o}}n aproximada de la fracci{\'{o}}n de volumen de material graso presente en el h{\'{i}}gado) {\textgreater} 5,6{\%} seg{\'{u}}n lo indicado por la espectroscopia de resonancia magn{\'{e}}tica prot{\'{o}}nica (1 H-MRS) o la resonancia magn{\'{e}}-tica (RM) selectiva de grasa/agua cuantitativa. La EHGNA incluye dos trastornos anatomopatol{\'{o}}gicamente diferentes, que tienen pron{\'{o}}sticos distintos: h{\'{i}}gado graso no alcoh{\'{o}}lico (HGNA) y estea-tohepatitis no alcoh{\'{o}}lica (EHNA); esta {\'{u}}ltima abarca un amplio espectro de gravedad de la enfermedad, del que forman parte la fibrosis, la cirrosis y el carcinoma hepatocelular (CHC) (Tabla 2). El diagn{\'{o}}stico de la EHGNA exige descartar tanto las causas secundarias como el consumo diario de alcohol {\textgreater} 30 g en los varo-nes y {\textgreater} 20 g en las mujeres [1]. Un consumo de alcohol por encima de estos l{\'{i}}mites indica una hepatopat{\'{i}}a alcoh{\'{o}}lica. La relaci{\'{o}}n en-tre el alcohol y la lesi{\'{o}}n hep{\'{a}}tica depende de varios cofactores (tipo de bebida alcoh{\'{o}}lica, patrones de consumo, duraci{\'{o}}n de la exposici{\'{o}}n, susceptibilidad individual/gen{\'{e}}tica), lo cual hace que los umbrales cuantitativos simples sean, al menos en parte, arbi-trarios. Concretamente, los pacientes que consumen cantidades moderadas de alcohol pueden presentar de todos modos una pre-disposici{\'{o}}n a la EHGNA si tienen factores de riesgo metab{\'{o}}licos. Es de destacar que las repercusiones globales de los factores de riesgo metab{\'{o}}licos en la aparici{\'{o}}n de la esteatosis parecen ser mayores que las que tiene el alcohol en estos pacientes [3]. El diagn{\'{o}}stico definitivo de la EHNA requiere una biopsia hep{\'{a}}tica.

abstract = {This guideline is an official statement of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) on the role of endoscopy in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was adopted to define the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Main recommendations 1. ESGE/EASL recommend that, as the primary diagnostic modality for PSC, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) should be preferred over endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Moderate quality evidence, strong recommendation. 2. ESGE/EASL suggest that ERCP can be considered if MRC plus liver biopsy is equivocal or contraindicated in patients with persisting clinical suspicion of PSC. The risks of ERCP have to be weighed against the potential benefit with regard to surveillance and treatment recommendations. Low quality evidence, weak recommendation. 6. ESGE/EASL suggest that, in patients with an established diagnosis of PSC, MRC should be considered before therapeutic ERCP. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 7. ESGE/EASL suggest performing endoscopic treatment with concomitant ductal sampling (brush cytology, endobiliary biopsies) of suspected significant strictures identified at MRC in PSC patients who present with symptoms likely to improve following endoscopic treatment. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 9. ESGE/EASL recommend weighing the anticipated benefits of biliary papillotomy/sphincterotomy against its risks on a case-by-case basis. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. Biliary papillotomy/sphincterotomy should be considered especially after difficult cannulation. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. Biliary papillotomy/sphincterotomy should be considered especially after difficult cannulation. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 16. ESGE/EASL suggest routine administration of prophylactic antibiotics before ERCP in patients with PSC. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. 17. EASL/ESGE recommend that cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) should be suspected in any patient with worsening cholestasis, weight loss, raised serum CA19-9, and/or new or progressive dominant stricture, particularly with an associated enhancing mass lesion. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 19. ESGE/EASL recommend ductal sampling (brush cytology, endobiliary biopsies) as part of the initial investigation for the diagnosis and staging of suspected CCA in patients with PSC. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.},

@article{Hirschfield2018,
abstract = {Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in which a cycle of immune mediated biliary epithelial cell injury, cholestasis and progressive fibrosis can culminate over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic and environmental influences are presumed relevant to disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger age at onset ({\textless}45) and advanced disease at presentation are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease is increasingly diagnosed through the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and management of patients with PBC must address, in a life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA), alongside experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all patients and risk stratification based on baseline and on-treatment factors, including in particular the response to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical practice as an alkaline phosphatase {\textgreater}1.67 × upper limit of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is life-long and must address treatment of the disease and management of associated symptoms.},

The goal is to describe a number of generally accepted approaches for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Wilson's disease. Recommendations are based on a systematic literature review in the Medline (PubMed version), Embase (Dialog version), and the Cochrane Library databases using entries from 1966 to 2011. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system used in other EASL CPGs was used and set against the somewhat different grading system used in the AASLD guidelines (Table 1A and B). Unfortunately, there is not a single randomized controlled trial conducted in Wilson's disease which has an optimal design. Thus, it is impossible to assign a high or even a moderate quality of evidence to any of the questions dealt with in these guidelines. The evaluation is mostly based on large case series which have been reported within the last decades.},

In recent years, the rising prevalence of obesity has led to an increase in the number of cirrhosis cases related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Malnutrition, obesity and sarcopenic obesity may worsen the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis and lower their survival. Nutritional monitoring and intervention is therefore crucial in chronic liver disease. These Clinical Practice Guidelines review the present knowledge in the field of nutrition in chronic liver disease and promote further research on this topic. Screening, assessment and principles of nutritional management are examined, with recommendations provided in specific settings such as hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhotic patients with bone disease, patients undergoing liver surgery or transplantation and critically ill cirrhotic patients.},

abstract = {Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20-50{\%} at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.},
